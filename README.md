# sml
Some SML code

In `prelude.sml`, there's some basic functions like `id`.

In `flow.sml`, lazy lists; in `keyvalue.sml`, key/value pairs.

In files carrying names of list functions, there are eager, lazy, and key/value variants of such.

In `combine.sml`, something akin to relational join.

In `linalg.sml`, rudiments of linear algebra.

In `search.sml`, machinery for search with Kleisli arrows with the usual Kleene algebra operation. This is used by the parser. Simple parsers for s-expressions and indented trees are presented in `sexp.sml` and `tree.sml`.
